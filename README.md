# Building With Responsive Design

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/building-with-responsive-design) curriculum, copying The Next Web's homepage to learn responsive design

## Things I learned
* The basics of using media queries to create a responsive design
* Practice with grid and flexbox to make things 'naturally' responsive

## Things to work on
* Lower portion of the page is currently unstyled
* Navigation does not pop off the lower section and remain fixed
* Mobile-width navbar not implemented
